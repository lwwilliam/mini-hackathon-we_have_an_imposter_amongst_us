Job Description
The Senior DevOps Lead will lead the cloud (AWS) skills and knowledge acquisition for current DevOps team as well as the great infrastructure team. Aside from leading the team to develop, deploy and support new and existing systems including data processing and delivery tools, mentoring the current teams to elevate their skills to redefine their

operating rhythm in a plan-build-test-release-deloy-monitor cycle (DevOps cycle) is paramount. You will need be comfortable with frequent, incremental code testing and deployment utilizing various DevOps related technologies (DevOps philosophy).

 

Leadership duties:

Functional Leadership

Mentor and educate the team towards a competent and professional DevOps practice. Key domains of mastery include:
✓ Continuous Integration

o Continuous integration is a practice in software development where developers regularly merge their code changes into a code repository. Upon successful code merging, build automation begins followed tests automation after successful build. Continuous integration focus is to find and address defects quicker by the power of frequent build and test process. This will lead to improve code quality (software quality), and great improve time to validate and release new software updates.

 

✓ Continuous Delivery

o Continuous delivery is a practice where developers test their code changes through automated built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It follows from continuous integration by deploying all code changes to testing environments and promote these changes to production environment after a successful build stage. When

implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready software updates that has passed through a standardized test process.

 

✓ Microservices

o The microservices design approach to build a single application as a set of small services. Services run in their own process and communicates with other services through a well-defined interface using a lightweight mechanism (like HTTP, SQS, or AWS Events Bridge). These are business purpose built and are scoped to accomplish single

purpose task.

 

✓ Infrastructure as Code

o Infrastructure as code is a practice where infrastructure is provisioned and orchestrated through code. The skills to manage of these code and software development techniques, such as version control, continuous integration and tagging are critical to this practice. This practice will greatly facilities infrastructure programmatically especially

towards patching and security remediation will improve efficiencies.

 

✓ Monitoring and Lodging

o Setting up correct and proper monitor metrics and logs to is a critical skill as this will help organization between view their applications and infrastructures perform in real time, another important skills is in capturing, categorizing, and then analyzing data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure, as these information when interrogated

correctly shedding insights into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes. Active monitoring becomes increasingly important as services must be available 24/7 and as application and infrastructure update frequency increases. With monitoring, ability to create alerts give us look ahead ability to possible situations we may need to

pay attention.

 

✓ Communication and Collaboration

o Communication and collaboration skills is a key cultural aspect of DevOps. This skill will form a set strong culture for information sharing and facilitating communication using Confluence documentation, Service Now tickets and even wikis. This will speed up communication across developers, operations, and even other teams like marketing

or sales, allowing all parts of the organization to align more closely on goals and projects.
